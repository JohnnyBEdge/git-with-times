How do you think XML relates to HTML? 
XML relates to HTML in its structure and that they are both mark-up languages. 

What are some benefits of something like HTML using XML's syntax?  
XML has better defined tags giving it better semantics/readability. Essentially anyone who 
can read english can know what the data is being presented. 

What are some disadvantages? 
The disadvantages of XML is that tags are user defined and will vary user to user. 
It is also necessary to close every tag and be case sensitive, which leaves room 
for error if used to HTML.
